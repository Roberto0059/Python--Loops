<h1> Python-Loops Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.

1. This task can also be achieved with a while loop. Complete the while loop with the correct code to instruct it to display "Connection could not be established." three times. In this task, a for loop and a while loop will produce similar results, but each is based on a different approach. (In other words, the underlying logic is different in each.) A for loop terminates after a certain number of iterations have completed, whereas a while loop terminates once it reaches a certain condition. In situations where you do not know how many times the specified action should be repeated, while loops are most appropriate. <br/>

2. You are now given a list of IP addresses that are allowed to log in, stored in a variable called allow_list. Write an if statement inside of the for loop. For each IP address in the list of IP addresses from which users have tried to log in, display "IP address is allowed" if it is among the allowed addresses and display "IP address is not allowed" otherwise. <br/>
